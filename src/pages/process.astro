    title: "Budget & Planning",
    description:
      "Sharing your budget can feel awkward, but here's the truth: it's not a trick or a trap… it's a map that we can then use to build the right plan for you. The same concept can be executed at $15k or $50k, but how we approach it will be completely different. Your budget shapes the size of the crew, the equipment we use, shoot days, and post-production time. These are the factors that determine your video's final quality and style. Without a clear budget, we're working in the dark and might propose something amazing that's completely outside your range, or something affordable that doesn't capture what you're really after. That's why we ask you to include a budget in your initial brief. It's not about what we think we can charge. It's about delivering the best possible video for what you're able to invest.",
  },
  {
    title: "Research & Discovery",
    description:
      "Once we have your brief, we dive into research and discovery. This is where we learn how to shape the treatment so it aligns with your brand identity and speaks the right visual language. We'll explore what archival material already exists, identify projects that could serve as inspiration, and if music is part of the plan, start defining what it should feel like. This is also when we map out any parameters that might impact your timeline, from production needs to delivery dates. Building a calendar early helps us spot potential bottlenecks before they become problems, so everything runs smoothly from concept to final delivery.",
  },
  {
    title: "Prepro",
    description:
      "Preproduction is where details matter and timing is everything. Our experience has taught us what questions need to be answered and exactly when to ask them. When logistics are properly executed, they're felt, not seen. But when this step gets glossed over, small problems can compound into major issues fast. It's more than parking and snacks and more time for B roll, though those details absolutely impact crew morale. It's about building confidence throughout the project by consistently setting achievable goals, and that foundation starts here. The best part is, proper planning creates the space for reflexive creativity, and that's where the magic happens… where projects go from good to great.",
  },
  {
    title: "Game Time",
    description:
      "Production is where all the planning pays off. This is when the crew comes together, the cameras roll, and your vision starts taking shape. Complex projects with a lot of moving parts demand clear communication, and that's where our experience really shows. We keep everyone aligned, so nothing falls through the cracks. When the day gets long or unexpected challenges pop up, having a team that knows how to adapt without losing sight of the goal makes all the difference. Great production isn't just about capturing footage. It's about predictably, repeatedly creating an environment where creativity thrives and every shot serves the story.",
  },
  {
    title: "The Editing and the Alchemy",
    description:
      "This is when raw footage becomes a story, pacing finds its rhythm, and all the creative decisions made along the way start to pay off. We work closely with you during this phase to make sure the final product hits the mark, balancing your vision with what works best for the audience. Revisions are part of the process, and we build in time for feedback so nothing feels rushed. Once the edit is locked, we handle all the technical specs for delivery, whether that's for social, broadcast, or internal use. The goal is simple: get you a final product that looks great, sounds great, and does exactly what it's supposed to do.",

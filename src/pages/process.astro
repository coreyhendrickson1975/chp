    title: "Budget & Planning",
    tagline: "Budget conversations aren't about what we can charge. They're about what we can build together.",
    description:
      "Sharing your budget can feel awkward, but it's not a trick or a trap. It's a map. The same concept can be executed at $15k or $50k, but how we approach it will be completely different. Your budget shapes the size of the crew, the equipment we use, shoot days, and post-production time. Without a clear number, we might propose something amazing that's completely outside your range, or something affordable that doesn't capture what you're really after. That's why we ask you to include a budget in your initial brief: so we can deliver the best possible film for what you're able to invest.",
  },
  {
    title: "Research & Discovery",
    tagline: "You can't tell a brand's story until you understand what story they're already living.",
    description:
      "Once we have your brief, we dive into research and discovery. This is where we learn how to shape the treatment so it aligns with your brand identity and speaks the right visual language. We'll explore what archival material already exists, identify projects that could serve as inspiration, and if music is part of the plan, start defining what it should feel like. This phase is also when we build the calendar, mapping parameters and flagging potential bottlenecks before they become problems. Starting this early means everything from concept to final delivery runs smoothly.",
  },
  {
    title: "Prepro",
    tagline: "When logistics are done right, you don't notice them. That's the point.",
    description:
      "Preproduction is where details matter and timing is everything. Our experience has taught us what questions need to be answered and exactly when to ask them. It's more than parking and snacks and B roll time, though those details absolutely impact crew morale. It's about building confidence throughout the project by consistently setting achievable goals. When that foundation is solid, something valuable happens: planning creates space for reflexive creativity. And that's where good projects become great ones.",
  },
  {
    title: "Game Time",
    tagline: "Great production isn't just about capturing great footage. It's about creating the conditions where authentic moments can happen... on schedule and on budget.",
    description:
      "This is when the crew comes together, the cameras roll, and your vision starts taking shape. Complex projects with a lot of moving parts demand clear communication, and that's where our experience really shows. We keep everyone aligned so nothing falls through the cracks. When the day gets long or unexpected challenges arrive, having a team that knows how to adapt without losing sight of the story makes all the difference. Every shot serves a purpose. Every decision serves the film.",
  },
  {
    title: "The Editing and the Alchemy",
    tagline: "This is where we find out just how powerful the work can be.",
    description:
      "Raw footage becomes story. Pacing finds its rhythm. All the creative decisions made along the way start to pay off. We work closely with you during this phase to make sure the final product hits the mark, balancing your vision with what works best for the audience. Revisions are part of the process, and we build in time for feedback so nothing feels rushed. Once the edit is locked, we handle all the technical specs for delivery, whether that's for social, broadcast, or internal use. The goal isn't just a final product that looks and sounds great. It's one that does exactly what it was meant to do: tell your story in a way that sticks.",

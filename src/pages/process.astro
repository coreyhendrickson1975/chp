    title: "Refinement & Inking",

      "Once we align on a concept, I refine the chosen sketch into a tight pencil drawing, then ink the final piece by hand using brush pens, pointed nibs, or flat brushes depending on the desired style and texture.",

    title: "Digital Polish",
    description:
      "The inked artwork is scanned at high resolution and brought into the digital environment. Here I clean up letterforms, adjust spacing and weight, and prepare the piece for its final application — whether that is print, packaging, or screen.",

            <p>
              I started Corey Hendrickson Productions in 2005. For two decades I have specialized in creating story-driven projects that help organizations and brands grow and connect with their audiences. In the field, I find common ground with folks easily, travel light and build crews that are nimble. I believe the best work happens when creativity meets intention, when every frame serves the story, and when that story rings true to those represented.
            </p>
            <p>
              My experience producing, directing and editing has me trained to filter creative decisions through the story, not the spreadsheet. Whether in preproduction or behind the camera, my mind is always working towards the edit. Working with talented collaborators, I've produced, directed, and edited projects that have aired nationally and won recognition, but what drives me isn't the accolades. It's the opportunity to collaborate with people who have something meaningful to share and to help them reach the audiences who need to hear it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Based in Vermont, I work throughout New England and beyond, bringing stories to life for clients who value craft, connection, and impact. I live with my wife and two kids, and when I'm not working, you'll find me XC skiing, biking, or backpacking—always with a camera in hand.
